# Workaround https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/3645. Bazel doesn't calculate the
# memory ceiling correctly when running under Docker. Limit Bazel to consuming resources that
# fit in CircleCI "xlarge" class. https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#resource_class
# Note that we use less than the available RAM as bazel only estimates memory for actions
# and we don't want to accidentally run out of memory.
