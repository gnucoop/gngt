 * destruction are thrown instead of silently logged. Also runs TestBed.resetTestingModule after
 * each unit test.
 *
 * Without this patch, the combination of two behaviors is problematic for Angular Material:
 * - TestBed.resetTestingModule catches errors thrown on fixture destruction and logs them without
 *     the errors ever being thrown. This means that any component errors that occur in ngOnDestroy
 *     can encounter errors silently and still pass unit tests.
 * - TestBed.resetTestingModule is only called *before* a test is run, meaning that even *if* the
 *    aforementioned errors were thrown, they would be reported for the wrong test (the test that's
 *    about to start, not the test that just finished).
